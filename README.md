A simple contract which can be deployed by address A. 
Funds can be set to the splitter contract by A, and will be divided and sent to addresses B & C.
â€¢ currently using hardcoded values.
#Isues 
1.) Transfer to B and C is not yet working.

##TODOS

- Unit tests!
- Get the contract to forward 1/n its balance, n times. Hardcode 2 for now.
- Figure out the transaction costs to make sure that Alice always ends with a balance of 0
- Make this contract reusable (either through import or extension?)
